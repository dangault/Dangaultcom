        <h2>About Dan Gault</h2>
        <p>My childhood was filled with challenges, including sexual and physical abuse. These experiences shaped me in ways I didn’t fully understand at the time. I was called to preach at 14, but like many, I allowed the temptations of the world—women, drugs, and a reckless lifestyle—to take priority. I convinced myself that I was just living life, not realizing that I was heading down a destructive path.</p>
        <p>For years, I didn’t see my struggles as an addiction. I thought my behavior was normal, just part of how the world worked. But in reality, I was lost, numbing pain I hadn’t even acknowledged. It wasn’t until my arrest in 2017 that everything came into focus. In the stillness of a prison cell, I finally saw the truth: I had been destroying myself. That’s when I surrendered fully to God, allowing Him to rebuild me from the inside out.</p>
